# INTRODUCTION TO C++

Before we dip our feet into C++ programming lanuguage we need to understand what it is.

C++ is an object oriented, Powerfull general-purpose programming language, which can be used to develop Operating systems,games, firmwares etc.
C++ is a compiled programming language, the cpp compiler takes the c++ source code and converts it into the machine code which the computer can understand.

## TOOLS NEEDED FOR THE WORK

For us to be able to code in C++ we need to type our code somewhere on the computer, this was my first question I asked myself when I was starting to code "where do I write this code?, just on desktop?,.. there must be a place where am supposed to write this code to." After doing research then I came to realize that I have to write it on a text editor. But now am done writing on a text editor then?, I bet you are asking yourself the same question, Don't worry because I have already done that thinking for you.

The tools needed for us to successfully program in C++ is as follows:-
1. Text editor - for us to be able to write our source code and save it somehwere on the computer.
2. Debugger - This will help us be the dectective by helping us track and elminate bugs, another technical term introduced "bug" but don't worry I got you covered we will come to that in a moment.
3. Compiler - This now helps us convert our well written C++ source code which is human readable language to machine readable language for the machine to understand the instructions we are giving it to execute.
