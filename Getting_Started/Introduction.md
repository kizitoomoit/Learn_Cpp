# INTRODUCTION TO C++

Before we dip our feet into C++ programming lanuguage we need to understand what it is.

C++ is an object oriented, Powerfull general-purpose programming language, which can be used to develop Operating systems,games, firmwares etc.
C++ is a compiled programming language, the cpp compiler takes the c++ source code and converts it into the machine code which the computer can understand.
*source code* - This refers to the instructions written by a programmer in a human readable form ready to be converted into machine language.


## TOOLS NEEDED FOR THE WORK

For us to be able to code in C++ we need to type our code somewhere on the computer, this was my first question I asked myself when I was starting to code "where do I write this code?, just on desktop?,.. there must be a place where am supposed to write this code to." After doing research then I came to realize that I have to write it on a text editor. But now am done writing on a text editor then?, I bet you are asking yourself the same question, Don't worry because I have already done that thinking for you.

The tools needed for us to successfully program in C++ is as follows:-
1. Text editor - for us to be able to write our source code and save it somehwere on the computer.
2. Debugger - This will help us be the dectective by helping us track and elminate bugs, another technical term introduced *bug* but don't worry I got you covered we will come to that in a moment.
3. Compiler - This now helps us convert our well written C++ source code which is human readable language to machine readable language for the machine to understand the instructions we are giving it to execute.
4. IDE - This is an Intergrated Development Environment which is basically Text editor, Debugger and Compiler combined together into one program.

*bug* - In computer programming a bug refers to an error that accurs in a source code written by a programmer.

## SETTING UP OUR DEVELOPMENT ENVIROMENT

Now its time to get our hands dirty, lets get our tools for work and getting working already.
It doens't matter which operating system you are using because this tools (IDE) that we are going to use are available in Linux, MacOS and Windows.
We can choose to either use [Codeblocks]([https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries/) or [Visual Studio Code]([https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw).
