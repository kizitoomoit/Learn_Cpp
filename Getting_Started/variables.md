## Variables

In this topic we will look at what variables are and how they are used in C++.

A variable simply means a value that is prone to change depending on the condition or the information passed to it.

In C++ a variable can be of any data type.

When declaring variables in C++ you have to define of which data type they are, ie if you are handling numbers without any decimal places you will use int data type which referes to integer.

Before any variable is used in C++ it must have been declared.

In our example variable.cpp we have declared our variable age before using it or else the compiler will throw if we have not declared it.

After declaring our variable that is when we can assign data to it and this depends on the data type you declared your variable with.

In C++ the = is the assigning operator, when we said age = 63 we assigned 63 to the variable age
